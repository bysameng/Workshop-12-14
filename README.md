Unity3D Intro, with Ominous Pope Hats

## Importing.

To open the project in Unity, either download the entire project as a .zip file and open that, or you can clone it and open it. Either way, in Unity, just do "Open Project" and select the project folder.

Feel free to email me any questions or comments.
